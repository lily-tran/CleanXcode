CleanXcode

<p>A simple bash script to clean Xcode junk files to reclaim flash storage space. There are no caveats. This script shouldn't break anything. The files that are removed are past build caches and other files generated.</p>

<br>

<p>Just download the file <b>CleanXcode.sh</b>
<br>
To run the bash script, change directory to where the script is located and simply run the following command in terminal: </p>
<br>
```
bash CleanXcode.sh
```
